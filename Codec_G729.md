# Introduction #

I have begun to port ITU g729a codec implementation on iPhone OS.
I report below the performance and conformance between ITU reference implementation and my optimization.

For the moment the code is not released, but now the library is integrated in Siphon and it works fine(_because I haven't finished to integrate in Siphon_). Normally, a new version of Siphon should be released in September with g729a support.

## Performance ##

All tests have been realized on iPhone 1 with iPhone OS 2.2.1
