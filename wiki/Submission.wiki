#summary History of submission.

= Introduction =

I would like to write the process to submit one application for AppStore.
For the moment, Siphon was submitted three times.

= Third (27-29/11) =
I submitted Siphon (27/11) but I found a bug so I re-submitted Siphon (29/11) before Apple review.



= Second (~13/11) =
I submitted Siphon (~13/11) with new functionalities.
Apple refused because GUI was too close to MobilePhone application of iPhone.
In fact, with my compilation problems the GUI didn't work correctly. So I understand now why Apple refused Siphon.
I corrected these problems and now Siphon displays the status of connection.


= First (25/10) =
I submitted Siphon (25/10) before I leave in holiday with my family in Spain (Galicia).
Apple refused because I didn't give a SIP account (27/10).
So When I came back, I create a new SIP account and I gave them it.
