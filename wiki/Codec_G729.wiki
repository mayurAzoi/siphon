#summary g729 codec optimization.
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements

= Introduction =

I have begun to port ITU g729a codec implementation on iPhone OS.
I report below the performance and conformance between ITU reference implementation and my optimization.

For the moment the code is not released, --because I haven't finished to integrate in Siphon-- . Normally, a new version of Siphon should be released in September with g729a support.
