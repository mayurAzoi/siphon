Home of the World's first free SIP/VoIP application for iPhone and iPod Touch 1 and 2.

Siphon SIP/VoIP project is the first in his category that works on iPhone and **iPod Touch 2 with headset** for all SIP providers. It is a native application approved running on 2.X using internal micro/speaker and headset.

The Application supports the SIP standard, preserving compatibility with hundreds of [SIP providers](SIPSettings.md) and offers a GUI which preserves the apple design of native iPhone applications.

Be careful, this version didn't test on iPod Touch 1. One thing is sure, Touchmod's micro doesn't work with iPhone 2.X OS. You need a microphone with a HW key inside “approved” by Apple. Such a microphone are: iVoice III from Macally.

Currently, Siphon is localized in 15 [languages](Localization.md).
